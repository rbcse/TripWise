Welcome to Tripwise - An online Trip Planner

**Problem Statement** - Often we go to trips without a planning , many of us have like today dad is free so he says lets go to xyz place. Now we don't know which places , hotels , restaurants / Dhaba , and religious places we want to visit and we search on internet sometimes which wastes a LOT OF TIME. So this web application solves this problem where you can apply search filters and also set a sequence according to your convienience.
